# Python Basics – User Input, Strings, and If/Else

This project shows how to use Python to interact with the computer by asking questions and making choices.

## ✨ What You’ll Learn
- **Input:** How to ask the user for information.  
- **Strings:** How to store and use text in your program.  
- **Printing:** How to show messages on the screen.  
- **If/Else:** How to make decisions in your code.  

## How It Works
1. The computer asks for your username.  
2. It shows greetings using different ways of combining text.  
3. You type your favorite color.  
4. The computer checks if your favorite color is the same as the program’s favorite color.  
   - If it matches → it says you like the same color.  
   - If it doesn’t match → it still says your color is awesome.  

## Example Output
```python
Enter your name: Alice
Hello Alice! Welcome to the program.
What is your favorite color? Blue
Blue is awesome!
